  hi hong

  the video is the "floridita soundbite" one in https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1cbllZ-pVIUVJnC05Yz6VUY6UHGNc9KwJ

  download it and put it in /assets/

  There's a {.video} field at the bottom of the Spectate doc that drives this thing https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l22Ub6jRGoUTZ7H4Uti73z4qiluiCs91E7wLO-dH1Qc/edit. change the 'asset' field inside of that to whatever you named the video. after you `make download`, the asset field you just changed should be available in this file at `item.value.asset`

  so yea we're basically just doing a video now lol. idk do whatever u want w it/have fun, e.g. styling the controls, setting the width, making it responsive, etc

    - https://www.newyorker.com/video/watch/how-bernie-sanders-s-outreach-into-latino-neighborhoods-is-working

  styles shud go in /src/styles.scss. scripts in /src/script.js if ur feeling fancy.

  p.s. if you're super bored/wanna spend 2 hours on this: ignore steph & convert the video into audio and just do the original audio-controls-overlaid-on-image thing ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
